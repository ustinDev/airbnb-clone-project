# 🏠 AirBnB Clone Project

## 📖 Overview
The **AirBnB Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that replicates the core features of the AirBnB platform.  
It allows users to create accounts, list properties, make reservations, and manage bookings — all through an intuitive interface.  

The main goal of this project is to **understand and build a complete web application from scratch**, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies while following good software engineering practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a scalable, maintainable web application.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and property listings.
- Learn how to integrate databases, APIs, and user authentication.
- Practice deployment and continuous integration with CI/CD tools.

---


## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Frontend:**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React.js or Vue.js (depending on the project we are given but I'm good with both)

**Backend:**  
- Python (Will be using Flask or Django framework)  
- RESTful API design principles

**Database:**  
- MySQL or PostgreSQL  

**Version Control & Deployment:**  
- Git & GitHub for collaboration and source control  
- Docker for containerization  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

---


## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ustinDev/airbnb-clone-project.git



## 🧩 CI/CD Pipeline

### 🔍 What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are modern software development practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that every change pushed to the repository is automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release process, allowing new updates to be deployed to production environments quickly and reliably.  

Together, CI/CD pipelines help development teams detect issues early, maintain high code quality, and deliver features faster.

---

### 🚀 Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
For the **AirBnB Clone Project**, implementing a CI/CD pipeline:
- Ensures that new code commits are automatically tested before merging.  
- Reduces manual errors during deployment.  
- Enables faster delivery of updates and bug fixes.  
- Improves team collaboration by keeping the application in a deployable state at all times.  
- Provides confidence in the stability and reliability of the codebase.

---

### 🛠 Tools Used
A variety of tools can be used to implement CI/CD pipelines efficiently:

- **GitHub Actions** – Automates build, test, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker** – Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.  
- **Jenkins** – Provides a flexible automation server for complex pipeline management.  
- **Travis CI / CircleCI** – Cloud-based CI/CD services that easily integrate with GitHub repositories.  
- **AWS / Heroku / Netlify** – Platforms for deploying and hosting the application automatically once the pipeline passes.

---

### ⚙️ Example Workflow
A basic CI/CD process for this project could look like this:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.  
2. **GitHub Actions** triggers automated tests (linting, unit tests, etc.).  
3. If tests pass, the code is built into a **Docker image**.  
4. The image is deployed to a staging or production server automatically.  
5. Notifications are sent to the team when the deployment succeeds or fails.

---

✅ **In summary:**  
Implementing CI/CD ensures a smooth, automated, and reliable development workflow — helping the team deliver high-quality software quickly and consistently.
